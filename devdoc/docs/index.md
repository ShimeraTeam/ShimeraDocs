# **Shimera**

The SHIMERA project is a library, also referred to as an _SDK_ ("_software development kit_"), designed to allow its user (mainly technicians) to implement visual effects on top of their graphical project.

The final goal of the project is to enable any graphical project, regardless of its architecture, to integrate SHIMERA within its operational loop. Additionally, the range of available visual effects is not limited to any particular software industry.
