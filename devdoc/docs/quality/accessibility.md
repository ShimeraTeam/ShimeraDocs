## Target Audience

The SHIMERA project is intended for developers working on graphical projects, whether in video games, virtual reality, augmented reality, or other graphical applications. It is designed for developers who wish to integrate advanced visual effects into their projects. SHIMERA is primarily focused on development and does not provide solutions for disabilities other than visual impairments. Regarding accessibility for the developer themselves, it is their responsibility to implement solutions adapted to their own disability.

## Visually Impaired Users
Since SHIMERA is a library composed of shaders, we provide shaders that address various vision problems, including:

- **Color blindness**: We offer shaders that correct multiple types of color blindness, such as protanopia, deuteranopia, and tritanopia. These shaders adjust colors to make visual elements more accessible to people affected by these forms of color blindness.
- **Blurred vision**: Shaders are available to simulate blurred vision, allowing developers to test how their applications appear to people with reduced visual clarity.
- **High contrast**: Shaders are provided to enhance the contrast of visual elements, making reading and navigation easier for visually impaired users.

## Other Disabilities
Since SHIMERA is primarily based on visual effects, it cannot address disabilities other than visual impairments.
